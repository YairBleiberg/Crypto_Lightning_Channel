This project implements a simple bidirectional lightning channel between Alice and Bob in Solidity and Python (with the eth-brownie package). The advantage of lightning channels is not having to exchange payments through the blockchain, which is both slow and results in high transaction fees. Nodes can exchange IOU messages, and may close the channel at any time. If one participant closes the channel according to an old state (an old partition of funds), the other can “appeal” using a newer signed message (with a higher serial number).
